    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Script of Scripts (SoS)](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/index.html#content) is a scripting language designed for the execution of workflows that involve the analysis of data in multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a web-based notebook environment that allows the use of multiple scripting language in a single notebook, with data flowing freely within and across languages. SoS Notebook enables researchers to perform sophisticated bioinformatic analysis using the most suitable tools for different parts of the workflow, without the limitations of a particular language or complications of cross-language communications. If you are interested in `SoS`, you can read more about it in [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/21/3768/5001386).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore some basic functions of `sos` in the analysis of UK Biobank, based on a simulated dataset. Before you start, first make sure that the general kernel for this notebook is in SoS (on the top right corner, you can select the SoS kernel after installation), and in each cell, you should choose the correct kernel (in the scroll-down list you should see at least three options `Python`, `R`, `SoS`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the instructions throughout this notebook and run all the cells. Add cells under each question (in `Python`, `SoS` or `markdown`) to answer.\n"
