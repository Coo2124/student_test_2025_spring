# Introduction

This tutorial & exercise, developed in 2024, is designed for trainees interested in joining the lab directed by Dr. Suzanne Leal in [Center for Statistical Genetics at Columbia University](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/research/research-centers-and-programs/center-statistical-genetics#:~:text=We%20are%20a%20group%20of,statistical%20genetics%20and%20genetic%20epidemiology.). It reflects our expectation on your computing skills in R, Python, Linux shell commands, and hopefully your ability in learning new tools in bioinformatics and related fields. By completing these exercise you will first set up the computational environment on your computer, then perform some data analysis of small scale using some test data. However, it is important to point out that after joining the lab, most of the research requires access to high performance computing cluster in Linux, on large-scale data such UKBiobank and All of Us data.

You may generally write in one or two languages we mentioned above, but we believe that the learning curve for things you are not that familiar with (but required in this exercise) is reasonable. You are encouraged to search online for learning new tools, and even to ask ChatGPT if necessary, as the ability to search for answers and solve the questions itself is also required in our lab. However, if there is a blocker as you go through the material, please do not hesitate to contact us (rd2972@cumc.columbia.edu).
